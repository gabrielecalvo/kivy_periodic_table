# kivy_periodic_table
Kivy App that shows the periodic table and gives element property information for each element on click.

(This project more of an excuse for me to learn some kivy) 

## Prerequisites
have kivy 1.9.1+ installed

## Usage
- Run the *main.py* file to start the application
- Click on any element of the table so that the detail side page will slide in
- Click anywhere on the detail page to slide it back out and show the periodic table
- Enjoy :)

## Source
I found a good source of element properties ater a quick serach on google, [here it is](http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/2793/where-can-i-find-a-downloadable-spreadsheet-of-element-properties).
